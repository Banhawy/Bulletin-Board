# React Bulletin Board
This application is built from the ground up with ReactJS and is my first application with ReactJS.

To start the application clone the repo locally and cd into the *bulletin-board* directory then run the ```npm start``` command to run the app on a local server.

This app was built using facebook's [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) CLI tool and React's [extensive documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html).
